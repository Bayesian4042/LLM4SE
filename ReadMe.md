## 1. Software Requirements and Design
### 1.1 Software Requirements
- What a system needs to do and how it should work. 
- These requirements are categorized into functional and non-functional requirements.

### 1.2 Software Design
- Involves the process of defining the structure, components, functionalities, interfaces and their relationships within a software system.
Software engineers need to create detailed plans and design blueprints on software requirements and specifications to ensure that the software system can meet the users needs and expectation
